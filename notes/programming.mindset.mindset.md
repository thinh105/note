# [How to get experience as a software engineer - Kent C Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-get-experience-as-a-software-engineer)

- More Problems, More Experience
    - There's no shortcut to experience. You have to put in the time
    - You develop more experience as you bump against and solve varied problems.
    - Your brain is a muscle and it gets better at solving similar problems the more it's exercised in a certain way.
- [Where does experience come from?](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-get-experience-as-a-software-engineer#where-does-experience-come-from)
    - "Technical Experience" comes from experiencing different situations/problems
        - and then learning from those experiences
        - to improve your own response to the same or similar situations/problems in the future
    - Engineers who make the most of their "experience time investment"
        - are the ones who intentionally expose themselves to various software-related problems
        - and then work hard to overcome or find/build solutions to those problems.
    - So when you're looking to increase your own level of technical experience (and increase the return on your time investment), look for "**problems**."
- [Where can you find problems?](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-get-experience-as-a-software-engineer#where-can-you-find-problems)
    - Work and Open Source.
        - There is a never-ending, ever-growing list of software problems at most companies (certainly any company I would want to work for),
        - and the open-source community is facing software problems that you can pitch in and find solutions to.
    - Lower-level kinds of problems, **require some deep digging into the code** to figure out what's going on.
        - "There's some bug in this library"
        - or "this test is flakey"
        - or "when we deploy our app, we get a spike of 500 errors."
        - These kinds of problems are all over the place and **require some deep digging into the code** to figure out what's going on.
    - Be the go-to person for problems of a certain domain that you want to improve on.
        - You want to be the "accessibility expert" at your organization?
            - Do some research, and give a talk internally at your company.
            - Invite people to ping you with questions.
        - It's a cycle: The more questions you get about the topic, the more varied problems you'll be exposed to, and the more digging you'll have to do.
        - I actually never intended on being "the testing guy," but I developed a few experience-based opinions, and started talking about it.
            - It wasn't long before I didn't have to look for problems, they just came to me in the form of questions.
            - People brought their problems to me which made me even more experienced,
            - I was able to build [TestingJavaScript.com](https://testingjavascript.com/) which encompasses all of the knowledge that I've gained over the years of experiencing problemsâ€“my own and other people's.
- [How do you use problems to gain experience?](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-get-experience-as-a-software-engineer#how-do-you-use-problems-to-gain-experience)
    - One of the first libraries that I worked on was [angular-formly](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly) and I got into it because there was a feature that didn't exist that I needed.
    - I could have passively moved on to another library to retrofit its capabilities to my app (or vice versa ðŸ˜¬).
    - Instead, I looked through the code to see that what I wanted was possible, [then opened an issue](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/issues/16), followed by [a pull request](https://github.com/formly-js/angular-formly/pull/17).
    - A few months and PRs later, I found myself a core maintainer, and then later the sole maintainer of the project.
    - That whole project presented a TON of "experience-building problems" for me (as well as [opportunities to speak internationally](https://kentcdodds.com/talks/#json-powered-forms)).
    - I learned a TON about how forms work on the web and as a maintainer of the project.
- **When you find a problem. DIG.**
    - If you have problems digging, then awesome!
    - You found another problem to solve!
    - You can work to solve those problems.
    - The whole process will give you more experience.
    - Read ["Spelunking in node_modules ðŸ‘·"](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/spelunking-in-node-modules) for more thoughts on this kind of process.
- Another thing: **Document your findings.**
    - You'll learn and remember more by writing down the things that you learned.
    - It's even better if you present your learnings in a form intended for public consumption (blog post, youtube video, etc).
    - This will **require you to dig even further to confirm** (or debunk) your assumptions, **giving you more experience.**
- Bastinote
    - We should spend time to dig deeper into our own and other people's problems
    - Dig > Solve > Note > Show

# [The Thirty Minute Rule](https://daniel.feldroy.com/posts/thirty-minute-rule)

When it comes to coding (or anything related to it) there's a rule I believe in with all my heart. It's the Thirty Minute Rule.

The rule is that if anyone gets stuck on something for more than 30 minutes, they should ask for help. By asking for help after 30 minutes it addresses the following things:

1.  Often we are stuck because of something we donâ€™t know, making it impossible to proceed regardless of skill or intelligence.
2.  Makes it so we donâ€™t get frustrated by being stuck on a problem for too long.
3.  Sometimes simply formulating the question to ask allows us to answer the problem ourselves.
4.  From a business standpoint, reduces costs because instead of hours or days or weeks being stuck, we move on after 30 minutes.
