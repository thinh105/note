### A beginners trick I learned way too late in the game of learning to code: repetition repetition repetition

-   Take the last exercise you were shown/taught and repeat it three times.
    
-   **1st iteration**  is to make sure you understand what the hell's going on and can repeat it, do you understand the functions, the loops, the getters, setters and constructs? You won't understand because you'll need to keep referring to your last attempt, hence doing it two more times.
    
-   **2nd iteration**  is to do the same project again but this time without referring to old code at all. It's not about memorizing. It's about understanding what you want to do next and what tool you need to slap in your code to get there and knowing how to do it...well, a little memorizing comes in handy but at a certain point you're no longer memorizing and you're more just 'knowing it'. Can you clean up your code a bit? Can you Don't Repeat Yourself DRY it out some?
    
-   **3rd iteration**  is to build on it. Can you add another property to the Class? If it's HTML can you add 6 columns with images instead of just 2? Just add shit to the project with what you already know. Add stuff that you learned 2-3 lessons ago but haven't touched since then.
    

After doing an exercise three times you'll go from  **"Monkey See, Monkey Do"**  all the way to  **"Monkey Know!"**

### Lên web xem ví dụ, đọc API của công nghệ mới
một trong những cách hay nhất để tìm hiểu công nghệ mới là lên trang web của nó để xem ví dụ và đọc API đó.

###   Front End design

[JM-Mendez](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/u/JM-Mendez)

Since you’re not a designer and this is for a professional client, I’d suggest the following:

1.  [Install adobexd (its free)  8](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)
2.  [Install Zeplin (free for 1 project)  4](https://zeplin.io/)
3.  Download free restaurant sketch landing page templates like  [this  6](https://sketchrepo.com/free-sketch/foodly-restaurant-recipe-website-template-freebie/)  or  [this one  1](https://www.sketchappsources.com/free-source/924-restaurant-landing-page-sketch-freebie-resource.html). But any other free sketch template you like is valid as well.
4.  Using adobexd, modify it to fit the brand as you feel best works.
5.  Mark the components you want individual access to in zeplin.  [Instructions here](https://helpx.adobe.com/xd/help/export-design-assets.html)
6.  [Export to zeplin](https://blog.zeplin.io/zeplin-now-integrates-with-adobe-xd-cc-726c8a4b2f22)
7.  Code it up.

This will get you to deliver a contemporary, decently designed site. If you prefer to purchase better templates, look at places like  [themeforest](https://themeforest.net/search/landing%20page%20templates%20sketch). The standard license is all you need since it’s for 1 client. You can even add that to their bill if you want.

It may seem like a lot of extra work, but all you really need to do is google how to make any edits in adobexd that you want, and follow the steps I laid out. This process took me about 6 hours the first time I did it. Now it’s second nature.

Why do i recommend this? Someone is paying you money to deliver a product, not to practice. It’s better to focus on satisfying them since freelancing requires good word of mouth.
