# [Imperative vs Declarative Programming](https://ui.dev/imperative-vs-declarative-programming/) 

## Definition

+ Imperative programming is like **how** you do something
+ Declarative programming is more like **what** you do.

## Example:

1. When you go to the Red Lobster restaurant, you approach the front desk and say…

**An imperative approach (HOW)**: “I see that table located under the Gone Fishin’ sign is empty. My husband and I are going to walk over there and sit down.”

**A declarative approach (WHAT)**: “Table for two, please.”


2. “I’m right next to Wal-Mart. How do I get to your house from here?”

**Imperative response:** Go out of the north exit of the parking lot and take a left. Get on I-15 North until you get to the 12th street exit. Take a right off the exit like you’re going to Ikea. Go straight and take a right at the first light. Continue through the next light then take your next left. My house is #298.

**A declarative response:** My address is 298 West Immutable Alley, Eden, Utah 84310

3. About the car I drive. Am I going to drive an **imperative** stick shift car or a **declarative** automatic car?

## Analysis

It’s important to realize that many declarative approaches have some sort of imperative abstraction layer.

Look at all of our examples:

The declarative response to the Red Lobster employee (“table for two, please”) is assuming that the Red Lobster employee knows all of the imperative steps to get us to the table.
Knowing the address assumes you have some sort of GPS that knows the imperative steps of how to get to your house.
An automatic car has some sort of abstraction layer over shifting gears.
That was the realization that really made it click for me, so I’ll repeat it:

**Many (if not all) **declarative** approaches have some sort of underlying **imperative** abstraction.**
