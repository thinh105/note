## Clean one line: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `K`

## Find quickly file: `Ctrl` + `p` or `Ctrl` + `e`

## Clone a line: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Alt` + `â†“` (Numpad arrows on Ubuntu)


## Select all the same of selected word : `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `L`

## Select same word one by one manually : `Ctrl` + `D`

Follows the rules in RFC, there should be a separated blank line between header and body parts.

```js

//WRONG
POST http://localhost:55200/test HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/json
{
    "cname": "weile"
}

//CORRECT
POST http://localhost:55200/test HTTP/1.1

}
```

# How do I select an entire line of code as quickly as possible?

All you need to do is put the cursor anywhere on the line, do not make any selection at all and then do the desired command (Cut, copy, or paste).

When there is no text selected, cut, copy and paste default to selecting the entire line. Try it!
